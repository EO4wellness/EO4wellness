- 💬 In addition to learning coding, I enjoy cultural studies as well as learning new [languages](https://github.com/EO4wellness/Polyglot-Studies).
- ⚡ Fun facts-I enjoy being a "jack of all trades" sort of person. As such, I've volunteered and/or worked in a wide variety of industries, roles, and used a wide-variety of skills.  Unfortunately, I was hit by a several different tragedies, which I have worked hard to overcome! 
- 📚 While studying with [Udacity Scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/scholarships) I was challenged to maintain a daily [TIL(today-I-learned)](https://github.com/EO4wellness/T-I-L) repo. Udacity is one of my very favorite places to learn new tech online!
