- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my skill set. My personal tag is, "The Road to Code isn't Built in a Day!" I began my GitHub account September 23, 2019.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled in and learning at Udacity. Right now I am in Phase 2 of Bertelsmann Scholarship and Phase 2 of the Hybrid Cloud Nanodegree program on the Nutatix Scholarship. Previously, I studied Deep Learning A.I. with Udacity on the Bartlesmann Phase 1 and Phase 2 Scholarship of 2019 and 2020.  Previously, I've earned B.A. and B.S., and have been a life-long learner ever since. My passion in life, amoung other things, is following my incredible sense of interest in learning new to do things. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate in order to build my skills in both working on various projects and teamwork.

- ðŸ’¬ Why do I have languages on a coding page? Easy. I find it fun to interact with people from different cultures and who speak different languages.  I'm a life-long learner and am currently learning several languages. Finding Polyglot , I have reached the point where I am able to translate between some of the new languages I'm learning, even if it is just a few vocabulary words or key phrases/beginner sentences. Currently, my focus is on significant study of: Spanish, German, Welsh, and Slovak; Recently, I also decided to try my first non-alphabetic languages too (Japaneese and Hebrew--albeit much slower than the alphabetical based language study) and I hope to add more, soon.  I also want to learn Arabic, French, Italian, Latin, and perhaps a few others. I enjoyed reading and studying at University several so-called "dead languages" for their source documents and ability to research/find new info using source language buzz terms.  Other languages I've learned are Medical Terms (lol), basic, some machine language coding, used to write and tutor in Fortran, as well as teaching reading decoding (English) to those having trouble learning the language (native or secondary language acquisition).  My love of language learning, like coding, began early in life.  You can check out my profile, and current study streak here: https://www.duolingo.com/profile/EO4wellnes and I also enjoy the use of https://app.mondly.com and other means of learning (online conference calls, pen or key pals, etc). 
- âš¡ Fun facts-I enjoy being a "jack of all trades" sort of person. As such, I've volunteered and/or worked in a wide variety of industries, roles, and used a wide-variety of skills.  Unfortunately, eventually I was hit by a few tragedies which I have worked hard to overcome!
