### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
![Image of Thank You](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Thank-you-word-cloud.jpg)
Thank you for visiting.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my skill set. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled in and learning at Udacity within Phase 2 of the Hybrid Cloud Nanodegree program on the Nutatix Scholarship. Previously, I studied Deep Learning A.I. with Udacity on the Bartlesmann Phase 1 and Phase 2 Scholarship of 2019 and 2020.  Previously, I earned a B.A. and B.S., and have been a life-long learner ever since. My passion in life, amoung other things, is following my incredible sense of interest in learning new things. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate building teamwork and other project-based experiences and skills. 
- ðŸ’¬ Wonder why I have "thank you" in so many languages on this page?  Easy.  I'm not an expert Polyglot, but I'm working on building my knowledge of various languages including significant study of: Spanish, German, Welsh, Slovak, and I'm currently trying non-alphabetic language too (Japaneese and Hebrew--albeit much slower than the alphabetical based language study).  I also want to leran Arabic, French, Italian, Latin, and perhaps a few others.  My love of language learning, like coding, began early in life.  I also enjoy learning phrase and languages of dead languages and attempting to read some of the source documents in these other languages.  You can check out my profile, and current streak here: https://www.duolingo.com/profile/EO4wellnes and I also enjoy the use of https://app.mondly.com
- âš¡ Fun facts-While not a top-level expert in any of these areas, I enjoy being a "jack of all trades" sort of person. As such, I've volunteered and/or worked in a wide variety of industries, as well as in a lot of roles, such as the entertainment industry, wroting-producing-creating-editing my own short films, enjoyed musical pursuits including previous soloist roles, published and promoted several books, received compensation and sold prints for "my eye" in photography, produced layouts for periodicals as well as books, founded my own publishing company for unusual titles & themes to have a voice, been a co-host on a successful podcast, produced professional quality trascription in a variety of fields, developed a reputation for being able to find miss filed important documents while working for medicare, been in insurance, hospital, education (including distance education, Fortran tutoring, reading, remidial reading instruction), avoided many but was eventually hit by a few major tragedies which I worked hard to overcome, and other life-long pursuits.
