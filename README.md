- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my skill set. My personal tag is, "The Road to Code isn't Built in a Day!" I began my GitHub account September 23, 2019.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled in FreeCodeCamp studies.  I also study at Udacity. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to learn enough code to do some basic collab and team work.

- ðŸ’¬ I enjoy language studies, as well as coding study. 
- âš¡ Fun facts-I enjoy being a "jack of all trades" sort of person. As such, I've volunteered and/or worked in a wide variety of industries, roles, and used a wide-variety of skills.  Unfortunately, eventually I was hit by a few tragedies which I have worked hard to overcome!
