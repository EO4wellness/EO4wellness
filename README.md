## About EO4Wellness: 
[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=EO4wellness&layout=compact)](https://github.com/EO4wellness/github-readme-stats)
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my skill set. My personal tag is, "The Road to Code isn't Built in a Day!" I began my GitHub account September 23, 2019.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled in and learning at Udacity. Right now I am in Phase 2 of Bertelsmann Scholarship and Phase 2 of the Hybrid Cloud Nanodegree program on the Nutatix Scholarship. Previously, I studied Deep Learning A.I. with Udacity on the Bartlesmann Phase 1 and Phase 2 Scholarship of 2019 and 2020.  Previously, I've earned B.A. and B.S., and have been a life-long learner ever since. My passion in life, amoung other things, is following my incredible sense of interest in learning new to do things. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate in order to build my skills in both working on various projects and teamwork.

- ðŸ’¬ Why do I have languages on a coding page? Easy. I find it fun to interact with people from different cultures and who speak different languages.  I'm a life-long learner and am currently learning several languages. Coding and Polyglot are similar in this regard. My love of language learning, like coding, began early in life.  You can check out my profile, and current study streak here: https://www.duolingo.com/profile/EO4wellnes and I also enjoy the use of https://app.mondly.com too. 
- âš¡ Fun facts-I enjoy being a "jack of all trades" sort of person. As such, I've volunteered and/or worked in a wide variety of industries, roles, and used a wide-variety of skills.  Unfortunately, eventually I was hit by a few tragedies which I have worked hard to overcome!
